Bankless Community Remix
========================

Bankless community refresh is an endeavour to reimagine the bankless community site. The goal is to give
newcomers a window into the soul of the Bankless DAO. Show them our mission and give them the tools to become a member and most importantly: How to live the bankless live!

Currently deployed at [https://gobankless.ghost.io/](https://gobankless.ghost.io/)
